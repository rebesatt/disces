\section{Problem Setting}
\label{sec:problem}

Below, we
introduce a model for queries over event streams
(\autoref{sec:streams}),
before turning to the problem of query discovery
(\autoref{sec:discovery}).



\subsection{Event Streams and Queries}
\label{sec:streams}


\sstitlenoskip{Event streams}
We adopt a model of multivariate event streams, similar to the one
of relational data stream
processing~\cite{DBLP:journals/vldb/ArasuBW06}. It is
based on the
notion of an \update{M8\\R2O2}{\textbf{event schema}}, which is a tuple of
attributes
$\mathcal{A}= (A_1, \ldots, A_n)$. Each attribute $A_i$, $1\leq i\leq
n$, is of a primitive data type, for which the finite domain is denoted by
$\dom(A_i)$.

Without loss of generality, we assume that all events have a single schema
and that all domains
are distinct, i.e., $\cap_{i=1}^n \dom(A_i) =
\emptyset$. If events actually have different
attributes, they may
be modelled with an event
schema that is the union of all possible attributes, assigning a dedicated
symbol that is ignored in the discovery process to attributes that are not
set.
The schema includes an alphabet $\Gamma =
\bigcup_{i=1}^n{\dom(A_i)}$, i.e.,
the set of all attribute values.
An \update{M8\\R2O2}{\textbf{event}} $e=(a_1, \ldots, a_n)$ is a tuple of
attribute
values that instantiates the event schema, i.e., $a_i\in \dom(A_i)$ for $1\leq
i\leq n$, and we write
$e.A_i$ to refer to the value of attribute $A_i$ of event $e$.
The starting point for query discovery is an \update{}{\textbf{event
stream}}, a finite
sequence of events $S=\langle e_1, \ldots, e_l
\rangle$ {that are ordered by their occurrence time,
with $|S|$
denoting its length. It represents a
finite subsequence recorded of a
potentially unbounded sequence of events.}
Here, we write $S[i]$ for the $i$-th
event in the stream. A \update{}{\textbf{stream database}} is a set
of
streams $D=\{S_1,\ldots, S_d\}$, which may overlap in their contained events.
A stream database $D$ induces the supported stream alphabet
$\Gamma_D \subseteq \Gamma$, containing all values that occur in every stream,
i.e.,

$\Gamma_D = \{a \in \Gamma \mid \forall \ S \in D: \exists \
j\in\{1,\dots,|S|\}, i\in\{1,\dots,n\}: S[j].A_i = a\}$.

\sstitle{Event queries}

Queries over event streams describe sequences of events that are
correlated by predicates over their attribute
values~\cite{DBLP:conf/sigmod/ZhangDI14,DBLP:journals/vldb/GiatrakosAADG20}.
While many models include a time window for event occurrences, in our
setting, the temporal
context is induced by the streams of a database.
{Hence, we
do not model a time window explicitly, but note that it may be derived from
the maximal time difference of events observed in one of the streams.}


To capture event queries, we adopt a linearized
representation,
inspired by~\cite{DBLP:conf/btw/Kleest-Meissner23},
that is well suited to describe discovery algorithms.
Let $\mathcal{A} =
(A_1, \ldots, A_n)$ be an event schema, $\mathcal{X}$ a finite set of variables
with $\mathcal{X}\cap
\Gamma=\emptyset$, and $\_ \notin \mathcal{X}\cup
\Gamma$ a placeholder symbol. Then, a \update{M8\\R2O2}{\textbf{query term}}
$t=(u_{1},\ldots,u_{n})$ is an $n$-tuple built of attribute
values, variables, and placeholders, i.e.,
$u_{j}\in \dom(A_j) \cup \mathcal{X} \cup \{ \_ \}$, $1\leq j\leq n$, such that
not all its components are placeholders, i.e., it holds that $u_{j}\in
\dom(A_j) \cup \mathcal{X}$ for at least one $1\leq j\leq n$.
The empty query term $\varepsilon$ is the $n$-tuple comprising only
placeholders, i.e., 
$\varepsilon=(\_,\dots,\_)$.
An event
query is a finite sequence of query terms, $q=\langle t_1,\ldots,t_k \rangle$,
with $q[i]$ denoting the $i$-th term. In a query, variables need to occur in at
least two query terms for the same attribute, i.e., for any term
$q[i]=(u_{1},\ldots,u_{n})$ with $u_j\in \mathcal{X}$,
$1\leq i\leq k$ and $1\leq j\leq n$, there exists another query term
$q[p]=(u'_{1},\ldots,u'_{n})$ with $u_j = u'_j$,
$1\leq p\leq k$ and $p\neq i$. The \update{M8\\R2O2}{\textbf{empty query}}
$\langle\varepsilon\rangle$ contains only the empty query term.
The universe of all possible queries is $\mathcal{Q}$.




Intuitively, each query term characterizes an event that should be matched by
the query. For each attribute, the term enforces a distinct value or
permits any value of the respective domain. In the latter case, a placeholder
models the absence of a constraint, whereas a variable that is used multiple
times enforces equal attribute values.
This way, equivalence
predicates over attributes of events are modelled.


Queries built of terms that contain only attribute values (and
placeholders) are called \update{M8\\R2O2}{\textbf{type queries}}; those
built of terms of only
variables (and placeholders) are called \update{}{\textbf{pattern queries}};
while those
that combine attribute values and variables are called
\update{}{\textbf{mixed queries}}.



To define the query semantics,

let $q=\langle t_1,\ldots,t_k \rangle$ be an event query and
let $S=\langle e_1, \ldots , e_l\rangle$ be an event stream.
A \update{}{\textbf{match}} of $q$ in $S$ is an injective mapping
$m: \{1,\ldots,k\}\rightarrow \{1, \ldots, l\}$,
such that:
\begin{itemize}[nosep,left=1em]
	\item for each query term $q[i]=(u_{1},\ldots,u_{n})$, $1\leq i\leq k$, the
	mapped event $S[m(i)]=(a_1,\ldots, a_n)$ has the required
	attribute
	values, i.e., $u_j = a_j$ or $u_j\in \mathcal{X}\cup \{\_ \}$
	for $1\leq 	j\leq n$;
	\item variables are bound to the same attribute values, i.e., for query
	terms $q[i]=(u_1,\ldots, u_n)$ and $q[p]=(u'_1,\ldots, u'_n)$, $1\leq
	i,p\leq k$, it holds that $u_j\in \mathcal{X}$, $1\leq j\leq n$, with
	$u_j=u'_j$ implies that $S[m(i)].A_j = S[m(p)].A_j$; and
 	\item the order of the events in the stream is preserved,
 	i.e., for $1\leq
	i<p\leq k$, it holds $m(i)<m(p)$.

\end{itemize}
If there exists a match for query $q$ in stream $S$, we say that
$S$ supports $q$ ($q$ matches $S$); and write $S \models q$.

\autoref{tab:notations} lists our notations.


\begin{example}
\label{ex1}
\update{{\normalfont M4\\R1O1\\R2O1}}{
Taking up the example from \autoref{fig:overview}, the stream database is
represented in our models as follows:}
\begin{center}
	{\footnotesize
		\begin{tabular}{l@{\hspace{.5em}}l@{\hspace{.5em}}l@{\hspace{.5em}}l@{\hspace{.5em}}l}

			 & $e_{35}$   & 5 & evict & low  \\
			\bottomrule
			\vspace{1.8em}
	\end{tabular}
	}
	\end{center}
The query $q = \langle
(x_0,\_,\_),(\_,\_,\text{high}),(x_0,\text{evict},\_) \rangle$
describes three consecutive events (but not necessarily \emph{immediately}
consecutive) in which the first and the last event have the same job id,
the priority of the second event is high and the status of the last event is
evict.
The query does not match $S_1$. It matches $S_2$ and $S_3$, with $e_{21},
e_{22}, e_{23}$ and $e_{32},e_{33},e_{35}$, respectively.
\end{example}



\subsection{Query Discovery}
\label{sec:discovery}

Given a stream database, the problem of event query discovery relates to
the identification of event queries that are supported by all streams, i.e., for
which there exists at least a single match for each stream.

However, there may exist queries that are
supported
by all streams, but which are comparable in the sense that one of them
is stricter than another one. Formally, a query $q$ is defined as stricter
than a query $q'$, denoted by $q\prec q'$, if

(i) for any possible stream $S$ (not necessarily contained in a given stream
database), $S \models q$ implies $S
\models q'$, and (ii) there exists a stream $S$, such that $S \models q'$,
but $S \not\models q$.

In event query discovery, we are only interested in the strictest queries
that are supported by all streams. The reason being that these queries
denote the most {concise} characterization of the
patterns linked to a situation of interest. For a stream database $D$, we
therefore
consider a notion of descriptiveness~\cite{icdt2022}: A query $q$ is
\update{}{\textbf{descriptive}} \update{M8\\R2O2}{}for $D$,
if it is supported by $D$ and
there does not exist a query $q'$ that is stricter, $q'\prec q$, and that is
also supported by the stream database $D$.
Based thereon, we formulate the problem of event query discovery:

\begin{problem}[Event Query Discovery]
\label{problem}
Given a stream database $D=\{S_1,\ldots, S_d\}$,
the problem of event query discovery is to construct the set of queries $Q$,
such that:
\begin{itemize}[nosep,left=1em]
  \item ${Q}$ is correct: each $q\in Q$ creates at least a single match for
  all streams, i.e., for all $q\in Q$ and $S\in D$ it holds that $S \models
  q$;
  \item ${Q}$ is descriptive: only the strictest queries are considered,
  i.e., for all $q,q'\in Q$ it holds that neither $q\prec q'$ nor $q'\prec q$;
  \item ${Q}$ is complete: if a query $q$ is both correct and descriptive,
  then it holds that $q\in Q$, {i.e., ${Q}$ contains
  all queries
  that are both correct and descriptive.}
  \end{itemize}
\end{problem}

\begin{example}
Consider the following two queries:
\begin{align*}
    q_1 &= \langle (x_0,\text{schedule},\text{low}),(\_,\_,\text{high}),(x_0,\_,\_)
    \rangle \\
     q_2 &= \langle (x_0,\text{schedule},\text{low}),(x_0,\_,\_) \rangle.
\end{align*}
\update{{\normalfont M4\\R1O1\\R2O1}}{Query $q_1$ is the representation of
the query from \autoref{fig:overview}
in our model.} Both queries match the stream database of \autoref{ex1}.
Also, $q_1$ is stricter than $q_2$: Any stream that matches $q_1$ will
also match $q_2$, but not vice versa. Query $q_1$ is even descriptive

for the given database.
