\section{Related Work}
\label{sec:related_work}

Closest to our work are iCEP~\cite{icep} and the IL-Miner~\cite{ilminer},
which both address the problem of event query discovery based on historic
streams. Yet, both
algorithms take ad-hoc design choices and adopt a restricted query model.
iCEP cannot discover queries, in which attribute values
occur multiple times. This limitation is addressed by the IL-Miner, which,
however, cannot discover queries comprising only variables.
\update{M5\\R3O1}{We discuss these language limitations in more
detail in our technical report~\cite{disces_TR}. However, we showed
empirically that the lossy version of the IL-Miner
suffers from incomplete results, while our algorithms outperform an extended
version of it.}

Our query model and the notion of descriptiveness is inspired
by~\cite{icdt2022,DBLP:conf/btw/Kleest-Meissner23}. Yet, the discovery
algorithms proposed in~\cite{icdt2022,DBLP:conf/btw/Kleest-Meissner23} are
limited to finding
\emph{some} descriptive queries, not all of them.


Machine learning approaches to anticipate situations of
interest provide an alternative angle to stream-based
monitoring~\cite{yanli2021,ARECEP,autoCEP}. The main drawback of these
methods,
however, is the lack of traceability of the derived
predictions.


Event query discovery is linked to frequent sequence
mining~\cite{agrawal1995,clospan,bide,DBLP:journals/csur/MabroukehE10}, which
considers solely
the level of attribute values, though. Our query model embeds a finite
sequence into
another sequence that satisfies certain
constraints. This problem setting is ubiquitous in foundational algorithmic
research, e.g., in combinatorial string
matching~\cite{DayEtAl2022,KoscheEtAl2022}.

Pattern discovery has also been investigated for
time-series data~\cite{streaming,crossmatch}, which, again, works only  on
attribute values and ignores criteria to correlate events by means of
variables.
