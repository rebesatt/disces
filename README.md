# DISCES: Systematic Discovery of Event Stream Queries

We propose four algorithms for the discovery of event stream queries given a stream database.

A detailed description of the algorithms can be found in the [DISCES technical report](disces_tr.pdf).

The experiments can be reproduced by running the scripts in the `experiments` directory. The results will be saved in the directory `experiment_results`.

In order to run the `synt_plot.py` script, the synthetic databases have to be created first by running: 
```python datasets/synt/synt_sample_generator.py```
