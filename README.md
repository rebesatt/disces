# DISCES: Systematic Discovery of Event Stream Queries

We propose 4 algorithms for the discovery of event stream queries given a stream database.

The experiments can be reproduced by running the scripts in the experiments directory.
The results will be saved in the directory experiment_results.

In order to run the _synt\_plot.py_ Script, the synthetic databases have to be created first by running: 
```python datasets/synt/synt_sample_generator.py```
